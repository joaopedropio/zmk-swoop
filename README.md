The configuration for my sweet daily driver [swoop](https://github.com/jimmerricks/swoop) keyboard with [snake dongle](https://github.com/joaopedropio/snake-dongle).

[Case](https://github.com/joaopedropio/swoop-case) designed by my wife.

## Keymap explanation

Heavily inspired by [Miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku) by *manna-harbour*. Every layer has something similiar to [home row mods](https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods) but is triggered using combos. Holding ST or NE is like holding control. Holding RS or EI is like holding meta. Holding RT or NI is like holding alt. To change the base layer from Colemak to Qwerty simply press QWRT key on System layer as show on the diagram bellow. To change back to Colemak, press CLMK. This action do not persist between keyboard initializations.
